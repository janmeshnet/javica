This software is still in design stage. 

Update: the architecture seems to evolve to a localhost php/www tiers that serves the web browser client, and a peer.js server running locally as well

Update : The whole architecture is being redefined using portable JS app and WebRTC



Roadmap : define the various API
          implement stubs for php-www tier
          implement stubs for desktop client tier
          code all this finally
